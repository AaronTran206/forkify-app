# Forkify Project
The user inputs a desired recipe. The app takes the input and queries an API which returns an array of recipes that matches the description. Clicking one of the displayed recipes will open a window that displays additional information about the recipe.

## Additional Features
* The user can bookmark recipes that they are interested in. These bookmarked recipes will stay stored in local storage for use on revisit of the site.
* The user can also remove these bookmarked recipes from the local storage by clicking on the bookmark icon again.
* New recipes can be created with the "Add Recipe" button at the top right. The user enters the ingredients and the specifications of the recipe. After adding the recipe to the app, the recipe will automatically be bookmarked for the user. The recipe will then be shown in the bookmarks tab with a special icon indicating it is a recipe that the user previously created.
